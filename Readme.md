Hi Citizen,

This project is the part of ALL IN HACKATHON. This project is currently a sample of what we wanted to achieve and because of time constrains we could not make it fully functional.

How to run :- 

Install VS code for the code.
Clone the github repository and open it in VS Code.
In VS code,install the live server extension and open every html file through it.The link is below to understand how the live server works.
